          I'm still not sure what to build with this project, I absoloutely,
          however, want to apply every little concept I grasp from the course,
          I'm willing my best to showcase my father how much I've been learning
          so far. It is not about the goal, but the journey. It might look big
          and impossible to reach, but it turns out it breaks down to this very
          moment. Memento mori!
